# All you need is to define LIBXC_ROOT in your makefile
# to point to your installation of the libxc library.

# If you cannot place a copy of this file in your libxc installation,
# place it somewhere else and define the LIBXC_MK_FILE_DIR to point to its
# containing directory.

# The symbols below are valid for libxc 2.2.0, at least.
